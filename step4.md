Now the course is done and you're free! As a final courtesy to us to help us improve, please write a final blog post with your thoughts on the course as a whole. What worked, what didn't? How about your own effort, what are you pleased with? What have you learned? Tying back to your first post, did you get the takeaways you hoped for?

Thank you all for an excellent time, and I hope to catch you all again further down the road to coding enlightenment!
