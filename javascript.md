If you have limited experience with JavaScript, or feel like brushing up on your skills, here are a few pointers:

*    Get a good book! There are several suggestions on the [Literature](../literature/) page here on the course web.
*    Go through Mozilla's [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide), which gives a very good high-level overview of the language.
*    If you prefer a more succinct overview you can instead check out [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/), which is more condence and focuses on the weird edge cases.
*    Try John Resig's [interactive learn JS app](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/), which digs deeper into the functional side of things.

The RIA course focuses mostly on best practices regarding code organisations which means that you don't have to know all the weird ins and outs of the language. However, if you aren't comfortable with the basics, having a high-level discussion about best practices becomes really hard, so we strongly recommend you to set some time aside to get up to speed if that is the case.

### JavaScript snippets

This is a collection of small educational snippets that we create in the course. They are stored as shared files in our [Slack channel](../slack-channel), but since that only holds a finite number of entries we also publish them here. If you have created a JS-bin (or similar) snippet you want to share, [fork this document](https://github.com/krawaller/ria2015/blob/master/javascript.md) and make a PR!
