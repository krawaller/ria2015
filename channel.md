The course does not have a forum, instead we communicate over a dedicated [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel. If you haven't already done so in a previous course you must first join the [Coursepress slack team](https://coursepress.slack.com/) by signing up with your student email (@student.lnu.se). 

When you are logged in to the Coursepress team you can find the course channel at [#2dv607-ria](https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv607-ria/). You are encourage to ask all non-private questions over the Slack channel so that others can take part, as it is likely that someone else are wondering the same thing.  

If you haven't used Slack before you'd do well to go through their [Getting Started tutorial](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206480347-Getting-started-with-Slack), as there is a bit of an initial threshold in order to wrap your brain around how things work.
