WIP

*    Start reading up on [React](../react-2), [Redux](../redux) and [React Router](../react-router), preferrably through playing around with the [Demo app](demo-app)
*    Set up your own tiny React app saying hello world! At this point it doesn't have to use Redux or the Router, although it can if you want to.
*    Have a think on what you want the project to become. What do you want to create?
*    Create a repo for the project on [Github](../git-and-github) and publish it. Remember to use the `gh-pages` branch!
*    Update your info on the [guild](../about-the-guild) with the project repo and description.
*    If you can elbow your way through the crowd, have another chat with David!
*    Write a blogpost about your impression of React, Redux and the Router so far. As always, register the post on the guild.
