###What Redux is

[ReduxJS](http://redux.js.org/) is a (very) small data flow control library. The purpose is to provide a central data storage, and ways to update/query that storage. It does so with a "uni-directional flow", which makes the app very easy to test and reason about.

Redux isn't tied to React, you can use it with pretty much any framework. However, because of the way data flow down the component tree in React, they are a very good match for each other. 

While reading about React you might have come across the term "Flux" - Redux is an alternative to that. If you use Redux in your React app (which we will do in this course), there's no need for a parallel Flux solution.


###Learning resources

Redux has [truly excellent official docs](http://redux.js.org/)!  You can also get [offline version](https://github.com/paulkogel/redux-offline-docs) to print or read on your tablet.

But an excellent first step is to watch the speech at React Europe where Redux's creator, Dan Abramov, introduces the library:
