In this course we use [Node](http://nodejs.org/), not as a server but for these three main purposes:

*    an execution environment for our build process, meaning browserify or webpack (more on those on the [project page](../project)).
*    an outer dependency module loader using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/).
*    an entry point into our build process by using NPM scripts.

This means that we're not really using Node in the normal sense, since we're **not** building a Node app.
