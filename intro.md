WIP

This is a lecture-free course in two parts;

*    creation of a RIA using cutting edge libraries and best practices
*    a theoretical deep-dive into a related tool or concept

Lecture free doesn't mean unsupervised! Instead, teacher time on this course will be spent giving active guidance in your project.

Also you are encouraged to help your fellow students with their projects. As all such aiding will be documented through pull requests, they count just as much towards your grade as the lines of code you write for your own project!

Throughout the course you will chronicle your journey in a **blog**. The level of detail is up to you, but much like with the helping of others, a thoughtful blog post will be worth as much or more as code.
